# Streamlit-Data-App
This project is an interactive Streamlit web application that visualizes and explores water quality data from Biscayne Bay. The dashboard allows users to view descriptive statistics, generate 2D and 3D plots, and view NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using a public API.
